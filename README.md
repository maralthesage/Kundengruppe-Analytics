In this project, i am going to create a datapipeline in which the Kundengruppe are computed from VS4 Kundenwanderung data regularly, then it is connected to the following data:

- Adresse (V2AD1001)
- Rechnung 
- NL-Data (from Simon's data)
  

  and this will show us not only the data of the kundengruppe, but also if they are NL customers, and how much they order and from which shop.
